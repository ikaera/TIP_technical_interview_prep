## UMPIRE + IOCE Methodology

### 1. Understand (IOCE Framework)

- **Input**: Parameters and their constraints
- **Output**: Expected results format
- **Constraints**: Problem limitations
- **Examples**: Test cases including edge cases

### 2. Match

- Identify problem patterns
- Recall relevant algorithms
- Recognize similar problems

### 3. Plan

- Develop step-by-step approach
- Select optimal data structures
- Consider time/space tradeoffs

### 4. Implement

- Write clean, efficient code
- Use meaningful naming
- Include comments where needed

### 5. Review

- Verify against test cases
- Check edge conditions
- Validate assumptions

### 6. Evaluate

- Analyze time complexity
- Analyze space complexity
- Consider alternatives
