You are designing an app for your festival to help attendees have the best experience possible! As part of the application, users will be able to easily search their favorite artist and find out the day, time, and stage the artist is playing at. Write a function get_artist_info() that accepts a string artist and a dictionary festival_schedule mapping artist's names to dictionaries containing the day, time, and stage they are playing on. Return the dictionary containing the information about the given artist.

If the artist searched for does not exist in festival_schedule, return the dictionary {"message": "Artist not found"}.

Example Usage:

festival_schedule = {

Demand for your festival has exceeded expectations, so you're expanding the festival to span two different venues. Some artists will perform both venues, while others will perform at just one. To ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts, implement a function identify_conflicts() that accepts two dictionaries venue1_schedule and venue2_schedule each mapping the artists playing at the venue to their set times.

Problem 3: Navigating the Research Station
In a wildlife research station, each letter of the alphabet represents a different observation point laid out in a single row. Given a string station_layout of length 26 indicating the layout of these observation points (indexed from 0 to 25), you start your journey at the first observation point (index 0). To make observations in a specific order represented by a string observations, you need to move from one point to another.

The time taken to move from one observation point to another is the absolute difference between their indices, |i - j|.

Write a function that returns the total time it takes to visit all the required observation points in the given order with one movement.

Problem 5: Calculating Conservation Statistics
You are given a 0-indexed integer array species_populations of even length, where each element represents the population of a particular species in a wildlife reserve.

As long as species_populations is not empty, you must repetitively:

Find the species with the minimum population and remove it.
Find the species with the maximum population and remove it.
Calculate the average population of the two removed species.
The average of two numbers a and b is (a+b)/2.

For example, the average of 200 and 300 is (200+300)/2=250.

Return the number of distinct averages calculated using the above process.

Note that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum population, any can be removed.

Example Output:

2
Example 1 Explanation:
1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].
2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].
3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
Since there are 2 distinct numbers among 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5, we return 2.

1
Example 2 Explanation:
There is only one average to be calculated after removing 1 and 100, 
so we return 1.
