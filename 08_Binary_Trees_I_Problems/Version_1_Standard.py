Problem 1: Grafting Apples
You are grafting different varieties of apple onto the same root tree can produce many different varieties of apples! Given the following TreeNode class, create the binary tree depicted below. The text representing each node should should be used as the value.

The root, or topmost node in the tree TreeNode("Trunk") has been provided for you.
             
P-lan
    Steps: 
        1) Start with the root node "Trunk".
        2) Assign "Mcintosh" as the left child of "Trunk".
        3) Assign "GrannySmith" as the right child of "Trunk".
        4) Assign "Fuji" and "Opal" as the left and right children of "Mcintosh", respectively.
        5) Assign "Crab" and "Gala" as the left and right children of "GrannySmith", respectively.
        6) The binary tree is now constructed as depicted in the problem.

Problem 2: Calculating Yield
You have a fruit tree represented as a binary tree with exactly three nodes: the root and its two children. Given the root of the tree, evaluate the amount of fruit your tree will yield this year. The tree has the following form:

    Leaf nodes have an integer value.
    The root has a string value of either "+", "-", "*", or "-".
The yield of a the tree is calculated by applying the mathematical operation to the two children.

Return the result of evaluating the root node.

Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.

Write a function to determine if a binary tree is balanced. A binary tree is considered balanced if the height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most 1.

Output: False
    P - Plan
        High-level: 

        Steps: 
        1. use func helper(node, height)
        2. base case: At the very bottom of the tree (i.e., node is None), we return True and set the height to 0.
        3. Recurse on left and right subtrees:
            1. Declare two new lists for height: left_height = [0], right_height = [0]
            2. Recursively call the helper on the left and right children
        4. Compute height and check balance at current node
            1. Calculate the current node's height:
                left_height[0] and right_height[0] are the heights of the left and right subtrees.
                    height[0] = max(left_height[0], right_height[0]) + 1
                    why? 
                    -We take the maximum of the two because the height of the current node depends on the tallest subtree.
                    -Then we add 1 to count the edge from the current node down to its child subtree.
            2. Then check if this node is balanced:
           
        Step 5: Combine results
        Step 6: Main Function
            Now call your helper function from the main isBalanced(root):
