Problem 2: Counting the Castle Walls
In a faraway kingdom, a castle is surrounded by multiple defensive walls, where each wall is nested within another. Given a list of lists walls where each list [] represents a wall, write a recursive function count_walls() that returns the total number of walls.

    U - Understand
        I - Input - a list of lists walls where each list [] represents a wall
        O - Output - total nums of walls
        C - constraints/considerations
        E - example/
        edge cases: 
        empty list of walls - The function should return 1, representing the outermost wall.
    P - Plan
        High-level: the number of walls can be counted by thining of each list as one wall, and recursivly counting each wall within it
        Steps: 
            Base cases: if list 'walls' is empty return 1
            Recursive case: return 1 (for the current wall) + recursive call on nested list 'walls[1]'

    I - Implement
'''
def count_walls(walls):
    # Base cases:
    if not walls: 
        return 1
    # Recursive case:
    return 1 + count_walls(walls[1])

# usage examples:
# HAPPY CASE
walls1 = ["outer", ["inner", ["keep", []]]]
# print(count_walls(walls1))
'''Output: 4
Explanation: The list represents four walls: "outer", "inner", "keep", and the empty list representing the innermost part.
'''
# EDGE CASE
walls0 =  []
# print(count_walls(walls0))
'''Output: 1
Explanation: Even an empty list represents a single wall, so the count is 1.

Problem 3: Reversing a Scroll
A wizard is deciphering an ancient scroll and needs to reverse the letters in a word to reveal a hidden message. Write a recursive function to reverse the letters in a given scroll and return the reversed scroll. Assume scroll only contains alphabetic characters.

    U - Understand
        I - Input - given scroll
        O - Output - the reversed scroll
        C - constraints/considerations - Assume scroll only contains alphabetic characters.
        E - example/
            HAPPY CASE
            Input: "cigam"
            Output: "magic"
            Explanation: The string "cigam" reversed is "magic".

            Input: "lleps"
            Output: "spell"
            Explanation: The string "lleps" reversed is "spell".

            EDGE CASE
            Input: "
            Output: "
            Explanation: An empty string should return an empty string.

    U - Understand
        I - Input 
            a string comprised of only lowercase alphabetic characters 'name'
        O - Output - returns True if the name is palindromic and False otherwise.
        C - constraints/considerations - lowercase alphabetic characters 'name'
        E - example/edge cases
        
            HAPPY CASE
            Input: "eve"
            Output: True
            Explanation: The string "eve" reads the same forward and backward, so it is a palindrome.

            Input: "ling"
            Output: False
            Explanation: The string "ling" does not read the same forward and backward, so it is not a palindrome.

            EDGE CASE
            Input: "
            Output: True
            Explanation: An empty string is considered a palindrome by definition.

            Input: "a"
            Output: True
            Explanation: A single character string is always a palindrome.

Problem 5: Doubling the Power of a Spell
The court magician is practicing a spell that doubles its power with each incantation. Given an integer initial_power and a non-negative integer n, write a recursive function that doubles initial_power n times.
U - Understand
    I - Input - Given an integer initial_power and a non-negative integer n, write a recursive function that doubles initial_power n times.
    O - Output  return doubled initial_power n times
    C - constraints/considerations
    E - example/ edge cases:
            HAPPY CASE
            Input: initial_power = 5, n = 3
            Output: 40
            Explanation: 5 doubled 3 times: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 40

            Input: initial_power = 7, n = 2
            Output: 28
            Explanation: 7 doubled 2 times: 7 -> 14 -> 28

            EDGE CASE
            Input: initial_power = 10, n = 0
            Output: 10
            Explanation: If no doubling is required, the initial power remains 10.
    
        edge cases: What should the function return if n is 0?
            The function should return the initial_power without any changes.
P - Plan
    High-level: 
    Steps: 
        Base case: if n is 0, return initial_power
        Recursive case: return func double_power passing doubled 'initial_power' and desrease n by 1

Problem 6: Checking the Knight's Path
A knight is traveling along a path marked by stones, and each stone has a number on it. The knight must check if the numbers on the stones form a strictly increasing sequence. Write a recursive function to determine if the sequence is strictly increasing.

U - Understand
    I - Input - list of int 'path'
    O - Output 
        if the sequence is strictly increasing return True | otherwise False
    C - constraints/considerations
    E - example/edge cases
            HAPPY CASE
        Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Output: True
        Explanation: The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 is strictly increasing.

        Input: [3, 5, 2, 8]
        Output: False
        Explanation: The sequence is not strictly increasing because 5 -> 2 decreases.

        EDGE CASE
        Input: []
        Output: True
        Explanation: An empty list is considered strictly increasing.

        Input: [7]
        Output: True
        Explanation: A single-element list is strictly increasing.
P - Plan
    High-level: 

    Steps: 
        1) Base case: If the list `path` is empty or has one element, return `True`.
        2) If the current element `path[0]` is greater than or equal to the next element `path[1]`, return `False`.
        3) Recursive case: Call the function on the rest of the list `path[1:]` and return the result.

I - Implement

def is_increasing_path(path):
    if len(path) <= 1:
        return True
    if path[0] >= path[1]:
        return False

    return is_increasing_path(path[1:])

Problem 7: Finding the Longest Winning Streak
In the kingdom's grand tournament, knights compete in a series of challenges. A knight's performance in the challenge is represented by a string challenges, where a success is represented by an S and each other outcome (like a draw or loss) is represented by an O. Write a recursive function to find the length of the longest consecutive streak of successful challenges (S).

U - Understand
    I - Input - 3 inputs: 
        string 'challenges', 
        int 'current_length'=0, 
        int 'max_length' wiht the default value of 0
    O - Output 'max_length'
    C - constraints/considerations
    E - example/edge cases
        HAPPY CASE
        Input: "SSOSSS"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The longest streak of consecutive `S` is three, found at the end of the string.

        Input: "SOSOSOSO"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The longest streak of consecutive `S` is only one.

        EDGE CASE
        Input: "
        Output: 0
        Explanation: An empty string has no challenges, so the longest streak is `0`.

        Input: "OOOOOO"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There are no successful challenges, so the longest streak is `0`.
